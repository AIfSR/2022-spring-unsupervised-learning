This package was designed to analyze the trajectories of nanodiamonds in macrophages. Machine learning algorithms were trained on synthetic datasets to predict the type of diffusion occuring within a trajectory based on the path of the trajectory alone.   

To install this package run the following command from the command line:  
```bash
pip install <PATH_TO_DIRECTORY_CONTAINING_setup.cfg>  
```

The public interface from which this package is intended to be used is the file Trajectory_Analysis.py. Import this file at the top of your python file with the line:

```python3
import AIfSR_Trajectory_Analysis.Trajectory_Analysis as ta  
```

Within this file, the "predict" function takes in a directory and will print out the results of predicting the diffusion types of all of the trajectories within that directory. Call this method with:

```python3
ta.predict("/Path/To/Directory/With/Trajectories")
```
